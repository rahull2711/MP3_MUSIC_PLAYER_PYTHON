This is a repository for the UNIcompiler Internship Task-3 (Mp3 Music Player) done by Rahul Thukral

Python Engineer Internship
Task-3 MP3 MUSIC PLAYER: In this task I have created a mp3 music player with a simple GUI using tkinter standard GUI library and pygame library in python.
In this task I have made a mp3 music player through which users can play their MP3 files and other digital audio files like flac, wav etc. without having to purchase a physical MP3 Player. This music player has all kind of functions like play, pause ,resume ,stop, next song and previous song. So the users can play their mp3 and other digital audio files ( flac, wav etc.) which are there on their computers/laptops.

Language used- Python
IDE- Visual Studio Code
